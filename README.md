# WorldGuard-Revision
Revision of the blacklist file

Any edits made must be checked multiple times. If there is even a single error in the syntax, a missing bracket, column, period, whatever, it will break WorldGuard and prevent it from working. It will also stop all the other actions in WorldGuard, such as growth blocking, trample prevention etc, it is not just this blacklist file.
